# 3D_Game_Board_STL
3D printed the STL file so I could start experimenting with it. I'll update the repo as I turn my ideas into prototypes. Here are some photos; you can put some sort of board on it (I used some card stock in the image because it looks nice) or, as I prefer, cardboard. As things get more intricate, I'll start 3D printing at least the frame of the board (printing the whole thing would use too much plastic to be sustainable). In addition, you can use it to hold small boxes. I don't have a good use to demonstrate why I added wholes to the legs yet, so that'll come later. Peas! ðŸ¤Ÿ
